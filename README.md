# Strings
This is an exercise to test two functions:
<p>int string_length(char \*)</p>
<p>char * string_reverse(char \*)</p>

string_length will return the size of a string as an int.
string_reverse will reverse the characters of a string and return it. It requires heap allocation to work, so it must be freed. Hence string_reverse_fr().

## Installation

No installation required. You will need the gcc compiler as well as make to run it, though.

## Usage

```make run``` to see the tests pass.

## Contributing

Criticism is welcome. I will not be taking merge requests. This was an exercise only.
